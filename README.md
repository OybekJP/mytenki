# MyTenki - responsive weather forecast web app. [see LIVE](https://mytenki.netlify.app/).
This is my first project that combines technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with APIs. 
The application that gives current, hourly, and daily weather forecasts for any location. 
I use OpenWeather APIs student pack to retrieve 3 different API requests to receive current data, hourly and daily forecast information.    

## Features
List of features 
* Display current forecast data such as humidity, wind, and temperature
* Diplay hourly forecast in 3 hour timeslots
* Display daily forecast for the next 6 days
* User freindly image teaching how wind directions work

## Tech
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* OpenWeather API

To-do list:
* Improve the hourly forecast data to display the current and next 3 hour timeslot data based on each location. Issue is that Openweather API doesn't clarify how to use hourly data based on differnt locations.  

## Inspiration
Inspired by Codecademy FullStack courses introduction to OpenWeather API. I had completed 40% of the course before completing this project.
